# Terms of Service
**Terms & Conditions**

These Terms and Conditions apply to the mobile device application CleanCraft (hereinafter referred to as the "Application") created as a freemium service by CL Tech Co., Ltd.

By downloading or using the Application, you automatically agree to the following terms. You are strongly advised to carefully read and understand these terms before using the Application. Any unauthorized copying, modification of the Application, any part of the Application, or our trademarks is strictly prohibited. Any attempt to extract the Application's source code, translate the Application into other languages, or create derivative versions is not permitted. All trademarks, copyrights, database rights, and other intellectual property rights related to the Application remain the property of the Service Provider.

The Service Provider is committed to ensuring the Application is as useful and efficient as possible. Therefore, they reserve the right to modify the Application or charge for their services at any time and for any reason. The Service Provider assures you that any charges for the Application or its services will be clearly communicated to you.

The Application stores and processes personal data you have provided to the Service Provider to deliver its services. You are responsible for keeping your phone and access to the Application secure. The Service Provider strongly advises against jailbreaking or rooting your phone, which involves removing software restrictions imposed by your device's official operating system. Such actions could make your phone vulnerable to malware/viruses/malicious programs, compromise your phone's security features, and may result in the Application not functioning correctly or at all.

Please be aware that the Service Provider does not assume responsibility for certain aspects. Some functions of the Application require an active internet connection, which can be Wi-Fi or provided by your mobile network provider. If you cannot access Wi-Fi or have exhausted your data allowance, and you cannot fully utilize the Application's functions as a result, the Service Provider accepts no liability.

If you use the Application outside a Wi-Fi area, please be aware that the terms of your agreement with your mobile network provider will still apply. Consequently, you may be charged by your mobile provider for data usage during the connection while accessing the Application, or incur other third-party charges. By using the Application, you accept responsibility for any such charges, including roaming data charges if you use the Application outside your home territory (i.e., region or country) without disabling data roaming. If you are not the bill payer for the device on which you are using the Application, it is assumed that you have obtained permission from the bill payer.

Similarly, the Service Provider cannot always be held responsible for how you use the Application. For instance, it is your responsibility to ensure your device remains charged. If your device runs out of battery and you cannot access the Service, the Service Provider accepts no liability.

Concerning the Service Provider's liability for your use of the Application, it is important to note that while they endeavor to ensure it is updated and accurate, they do rely on third parties to provide information to them so they can make it available to you. The Service Provider accepts no liability for any loss, direct or indirect, you experience as a result of relying wholly on this functionality of the Application.

At some point, the Service Provider may wish to update the Application. The Application's current availability is dependent on the requirements of the operating system (and any other systems they decide to extend the Application's availability to), which may change. If you wish to continue using the Application, you will need to download updates. The Service Provider does not guarantee that they will always update the Application to remain relevant to you and/or compatible with the particular version of the operating system installed on your device. However, you agree to accept updates to the Application when offered to you. The Service Provider may also wish to cease providing the Application and may terminate its use at any time without providing termination notice to you. Unless they tell you otherwise, upon any termination, (a) the rights and licenses granted to you in these terms will end; (b) you must stop using the Application and, if necessary, delete it from your device.

**Changes to These Terms and Conditions**

The Service Provider may update its Terms and Conditions from time to time. Therefore, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. The Service Provider will notify you of any changes by posting the new Terms and Conditions on this page.

These Terms and Conditions are effective as of 2026-01-01.
